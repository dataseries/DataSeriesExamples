/*
 * This program reads DataSeries files created by ds-simple-write.cpp
 * program and prints each row contained in the files, as well
 * as the total number of rows.
 *
 * To do this, we create a class that derives from RowAnalysisModule.
 * RowAnalysisModule is a built-in module that operates over every row,
 * one at a time. We override RowAnalysisModule virtual functions
 * prepareForProcessing(), processRow(), and completeProcessing()
 * to do specific analysis:
 *
 * prepareForProcessing() method is called once before
 * the first row is processed.
 * processRow() is called for each row.
 * completeProcessing() is called after the last row is processed.
 *
 * In this case, our analysis is very simple:
 * - print each row
 * - and count the number of rows
 *
