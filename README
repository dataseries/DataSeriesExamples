This package is a collection of simple examples for using DataSeries. It is
useful as a starting point for doing development, as well as learning how to
write programs.  Finally it shows two different ways of setting up the build
environment.

simple: Some simple test examples previously in DataSeries/src/example, or from
  the Stony-Brook Wiki.  Examples of how to read and write a file, merge files,
  and run multiple modules in series.

triangle-find: An implementation of triangle counting using DataSeries.  The problem
  was originally from https://github.com/vertica/Graph-Analytics----Triangle-Counting
  There are several implementations, the default is the fastest one in parallel.
